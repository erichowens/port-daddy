VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Critical Vulnerabilities Found: 0
High Severity Issues Found: 0
Medium Severity Issues Found: 0
Low Severity Improvements Found: 3 (optional)

Critical Issues: NONE
High Issues: NONE
Medium Issues: NONE

Low Severity Findings:
  1. Max ID length validation (libs/services.ts) — OPTIONAL
  2. Max session name length validation (lib/sessions.ts) — OPTIONAL
  3. Max TTL validation for locks (lib/locks.ts) — OPTIONAL

All LOW severity items:
  - Are NOT security vulnerabilities
  - Do NOT impact functionality
  - Are input validation enhancements
  - Can be implemented in 15-20 minutes total
  - Are recommended but not critical

================================================================================
SECURITY FEATURES VERIFIED
================================================================================

[✅] SQL Injection Prevention
     Status: SECURE
     Mechanism: Parameterized queries throughout
     Tests: Multiple SQL injection attempts safely handled

[✅] SSRF Protection
     Status: EXCELLENT
     Mechanism: Comprehensive IP range blocklist
     Coverage: IPv4 private ranges, IPv6 ranges, metadata endpoints
     Tests: 9/9 SSRF tests passed (all attacks blocked)

[✅] Race Condition Prevention
     Status: SAFE
     Mechanism: Atomic database operations, UNIQUE constraints
     Tests: 5x concurrent claims → only 1 succeeds

[✅] Concurrency Safety
     Status: SAFE
     Mechanism: SQLite transactions
     Tests: 50+ concurrent operations handled cleanly

[✅] Error Handling
     Status: GOOD
     Mechanism: Consistent responses, proper HTTP codes
     Tests: No information leakage observed

[✅] Input Validation
     Status: GOOD
     Mechanism: JSON limits, format validation
     Issues: 3 optional improvements identified

[✅] Database Integrity
     Status: SAFE
     Mechanism: Foreign keys, cascade deletes
     Tests: Consistency maintained under attack scenarios
