**Authoritative port management, service orchestration, pub/sub messaging, distributed locks, and agent coordination for local development.**

Port Daddy is a lightweight daemon that runs on `localhost:9876` and solves port conflicts, service orchestration, and multi-process coordination in a single tool. It assigns ports atomically, starts your entire stack with `port-daddy up`, brokers messages between processes, manages distributed locks, and tracks agent lifecycles -- all backed by SQLite for persistence and zero race conditions.

```bash
port-daddy up                    # Start your whole stack (detects frameworks automatically)
port-daddy down                  # Graceful shutdown, all services

port-daddy claim myapp:frontend  # Or manage ports individually
# → myapp:frontend → port 3100

port-daddy pub build:ready '{"services":["frontend","api"]}'
port-daddy lock db-migrations
```

## The Problem

Port conflicts and process coordination failures waste real time across three common scenarios:

**Solo developers** hit "Something is already running on port 3000" constantly. You restart your terminal, kill a stale process, restart again -- and waste 5 minutes before you can even start coding. Every web developer has been there.

**Microservice developers** running 5-10 services locally hit port collisions constantly. You start a frontend on 3000, an API on 3001, a worker on 3002 -- then restart one and discover something else grabbed its port. Docker Compose helps in containers, but local development outside containers is a free-for-all.

**CI/CD pipelines** with parallel test runners need deterministic port assignment. When multiple test suites run concurrently, each spinning up servers on hardcoded ports, you get flaky failures that are impossible to reproduce locally. The workaround -- random ports with retry loops -- adds complexity and still races.

**Multi-agent AI development** multiplies the problem. Multiple autonomous agent sessions launch dev servers simultaneously, each unaware of the others. No human is watching to resolve conflicts, and every port collision wastes an agent cycle figuring out what went wrong.

Port Daddy solves all four with a single daemon: atomic port assignment, semantic service naming, pub/sub messaging for coordination, distributed locks for mutual exclusion, and an agent registry for lifecycle tracking.

### Why Port Daddy?

Existing tools solve fragments of the problem. Port Daddy solves the whole thing.

`get-port` and `portfinder` are libraries — they find a free port and hand it back. No persistence, no naming, no coordination. Next time you run your app, you get a different port. Port Daddy remembers.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g port-daddy
port-daddy start
```

That's it. Now claim ports:

```bash
port-daddy claim myapp:frontend
# → myapp:frontend → port 3100

port-daddy claim myapp:api
# → myapp:api → port 3101

# Use it with any dev server
PORT=$(port-daddy claim myproject -q) npm run dev -- --port $PORT

# Or use the shorthand alias with --export
eval $(port-daddy c myproject --export) && npm run dev -- --port $PORT
```

Ports persist — `myapp:frontend` always gets port 3100 on this machine, even across restarts.

### Auto-start on login (optional)

```bash
port-daddy install   # macOS (LaunchAgent) or Linux (systemd)
```

### Scan your project (optional)

```bash
cd your-project/
port-daddy scan
# → Scanning /path/to/your-project...
# → Discovered 3 services:
#     api         Express    :3000
#     web         Next.js    :3001
#     worker      Workers    :8787
# → Saved .portdaddyrc
# → Next: port-daddy up
```

Port Daddy deep-scans your project recursively, detecting 60+ frameworks (Next.js, Vite, Express, FastAPI, Django, Go, Rust, Cloudflare Workers, Docker, and more). It handles monorepos, npm workspaces, and nested services automatically. See [Auto-Detection](#auto-detection-port-daddy-scan) for the full list.

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curiositech/port-daddy.git
cd port-daddy && npm install
port-daddy start
```

---

## Service Orchestration

Start your entire stack with a single command. Port Daddy reads your `.portdaddyrc` (or auto-detects your framework), resolves service dependencies via topological sort, claims ports, injects environment variables, and streams color-coded logs -- like `docker-compose up` for local development.

```bash
# Start everything defined in .portdaddyrc (or auto-detected)
port-daddy up

# Start one service and its dependencies
port-daddy up --service frontend

# Use git branch in the semantic identity (e.g., myapp:api:feature-auth)
port-daddy up --branch

# Skip health checks for faster startup
port-daddy up --no-health

# Graceful shutdown of all services started by `up`
port-daddy down
```

### How `up` works

1. **Detect** -- reads `.portdaddyrc`, or auto-discovers services via framework detection
2. **Sort** -- topological sort on `needs` graph (cycles are caught with a clear error)
3. **Claim** -- requests ports from the daemon atomically
4. **Inject** -- sets `PORT`, `PORT_<SERVICE>`, and any custom `env` vars per service
5. **Spawn** -- launches each service's `cmd` with colored, prefixed log output
6. **Health check** -- polls each service's `healthPath` (configurable timeout)
7. **Signal** -- Ctrl+C sends `SIGTERM` to all children in reverse dependency order

### Example `.portdaddyrc`

```json
{
  "project": "myapp",
  "services": {
    "api": {
      "cmd": "npm run dev:api",
      "port": 3001,
      "healthPath": "/health",
      "env": { "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp" }
    },
    "frontend": {
      "cmd": "npm run dev -- --port ${PORT}",
      "port": 3000,
      "healthPath": "/",
      "needs": ["api"]
    },
    "worker": {
      "cmd": "npm run worker",
      "needs": ["api"],
      "noPort": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment diagnostics

```bash
# Check your environment for common issues
port-daddy doctor
```

`doctor` verifies: daemon connectivity, port range availability, `.portdaddyrc` validity, Node.js version, and system port conflicts.

---

## Semantic Identities

Port Daddy uses a `project:stack:context` naming scheme that makes your services discoverable:

```
myapp                     # Just the project
myapp:api                 # Project + stack
myapp:api:feature-auth    # Project + stack + context
```

| Part | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **project** | Your application | `myapp`, `acme-api`, `todo` |
| **stack** | Component type | `api`, `frontend`, `worker`, `db` |
| **context** | Branch or variant | `main`, `feature-x`, `pr-123`, `staging` |

This unlocks powerful queries:

```bash
# All services for myapp
port-daddy find myapp:*

# All API services across all projects
port-daddy find *:api:*

# Release everything for a feature branch
port-daddy release myapp:*:feature-auth
```

---

## Agent Coordination

Port Daddy includes built-in primitives for multi-process and multi-agent coordination. No external message broker or lock service required.

### Pub/Sub Messaging

Agents and processes publish events and subscribe to channels:

```bash
# Agent A finishes the API
port-daddy pub build:api '{"status":"ready","port":3100}'

# Agent B finishes the frontend
port-daddy pub build:frontend '{"status":"ready","port":3101}'

# Agent C subscribes and waits
port-daddy sub build:*
# [2025-01-15T10:30:00Z] {"status":"ready","port":3100}
# [2025-01-15T10:30:05Z] {"status":"ready","port":3101}
# Now C knows both services are ready for integration tests
```

### Distributed Locks

Prevent conflicting operations across agents and processes:

```bash
# Agent A: Exclusive access to database migrations
port-daddy lock db-migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
port-daddy unlock db-migrations

# Agent B: Waits or fails immediately if lock is held
port-daddy lock db-migrations || echo "Lock held, skipping"
```

### Channel Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `build:<target>` | Build completion events |
| `service:<id>:ready` | Service readiness signals |
| `task:<name>` | Task handoff between agents |
| `errors` | Error broadcasting |
| `heartbeat:<agent>` | Agent health monitoring |

---

## Agent Registry

Agents can formally register with Port Daddy for lifecycle tracking and resource management:

```bash
# Register an agent
port-daddy agent register --agent builder-1 --type cli

# Send heartbeats (keeps agent marked as active)
port-daddy agent heartbeat --agent builder-1

# See all active agents
port-daddy agents

# Check a specific agent
port-daddy agent builder-1
```

### Resource Limits

Each agent can have resource limits enforced:

```json
{
  "maxServices": 50,
  "maxLocks": 20
}
```

When an agent exceeds its limits, further claims and locks are rejected until resources are released.

### Auto-Cleanup

Agents that stop sending heartbeats for 2+ minutes are marked stale. Their services and locks are automatically released, preventing resource leakage from crashed processes.

---

## JavaScript SDK

Port Daddy ships with a built-in client SDK. No REST boilerplate required.

```bash
npm install port-daddy
```

```javascript
import { PortDaddy } from 'port-daddy/client';

const pd = new PortDaddy();

// Claim a port
const { port } = await pd.claim('myapp:api');
console.log(`API running on port ${port}`);

// Release when done
await pd.release('myapp:api');
```

### Services

```javascript
// Request a specific port
const { port } = await pd.claim('myapp:frontend', { port: 3000 });

// Find services by pattern
const { services } = await pd.listServices({ pattern: 'myapp:*' });

// Set endpoint URLs for service discovery
await pd.setEndpoint('myapp:api', 'local', `http://localhost:${port}`);
await pd.setEndpoint('myapp:api', 'prod', 'https://api.myapp.com');

// Release everything for a project
await pd.release('myapp:*');
```

### Pub/Sub Messaging

```javascript
// Publish
await pd.publish('builds', { status: 'complete', artifact: 'dist.tar.gz' });

// Read messages
const { messages } = await pd.getMessages('builds', { limit: 10 });

// Subscribe to real-time updates
const sub = pd.subscribe('deployments');
sub.on('message', (data) => console.log('Deploy event:', data));

// Long-poll for next message
const { message } = await pd.poll('builds');
```

### Distributed Locks

```javascript
// Manual lock/unlock
await pd.lock('db-migrations');
try {
  await runMigrations();
} finally {
  await pd.unlock('db-migrations');
}

// Or use the convenience wrapper
await pd.withLock('deploy-prod', async () => {
  await deployToProduction();
});
```

### Agent Lifecycle

```javascript
const pd = new PortDaddy({ agentId: 'build-agent-1' });

// Register and start heartbeats
await pd.register({ name: 'Build Agent', type: 'ci' });
const hb = pd.startHeartbeat(30000); // Every 30s

// ... do work ...

// Cleanup
hb.stop();
await pd.unregister();
```

### Configuration

```javascript
const pd = new PortDaddy({
  url: 'http://localhost:9876',   // Daemon URL (or set PORT_DADDY_URL env)
  agentId: 'my-agent',           // Agent ID for tracking (or PORT_DADDY_AGENT env)
  pid: process.pid,              // Process ID for ownership
  timeout: 5000,                 // Request timeout in ms
});
```

### Error Handling

```javascript
import { PortDaddy, PortDaddyError, ConnectionError } from 'port-daddy/client';

try {
  await pd.claim('myapp:api');
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ConnectionError) {
    console.error('Daemon not running. Start with: port-daddy start');
  } else if (err instanceof PortDaddyError) {
    console.error(`API error (${err.status}): ${err.message}`);
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

External systems can subscribe to Port Daddy events via webhooks:

```bash
# Register a webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:9876/webhooks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/port-daddy-events",
    "events": ["service.claim", "service.release"],
    "secret": "your-hmac-secret"
  }'
```

### Supported Events

| Event | Payload |
|-------|---------|
| `service.claim` | Service was claimed |
| `service.release` | Service was released |
| `agent.register` | Agent registered |
| `agent.unregister` | Agent unregistered |
| `agent.stale` | Agent went stale |
| `lock.acquire` | Lock was acquired |
| `lock.release` | Lock was released |
| `message.publish` | Message was published |
| `daemon.start` | Daemon started |
| `daemon.stop` | Daemon stopping |

### Payload Verification

Each delivery includes an HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification:

```
X-PortDaddy-Signature: sha256=abc123...
X-PortDaddy-Event: service.claim
X-PortDaddy-Delivery: uuid
X-PortDaddy-Timestamp: 1704000000000
```

Verify in your handler:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify(payload));
  const expected = `sha256=${hmac.digest('hex')}`;
  return signature === expected;
}
```

### Retry & Reliability

- **Automatic retries**: Failed deliveries retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Delivery tracking**: View delivery history for any webhook
- **Test endpoint**: Send test payloads to verify webhook setup

### Database

Port Daddy uses SQLite for atomic operations:

- No race conditions between concurrent claims
- Survives daemon restarts
- Automatic cleanup of dead processes
- Pattern-based queries via SQL LIKE

### Security Features

- **SSRF Protection**: Webhook URLs cannot target private/internal addresses
- **Rate Limiting**: Connection limits prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **HMAC Signing**: Webhook payloads signed for verification

## Configuration

### Project Config (`.portdaddyrc`)

Define your project's services, port ranges, and startup commands in a `.portdaddyrc` file at your project root:

```json
{
  "project": "myapp",
  "portRange": [3000, 3099],
  "services": {
    "frontend": {
      "cmd": "npm run dev -- --port ${PORT}",
      "port": 3000,
      "healthPath": "/",
      "needs": ["api"]
    },
    "api": {
      "cmd": "npm run dev:api",
      "port": 3001,
      "healthPath": "/health",
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp"
      }
    },
    "worker": {
      "cmd": "npm run worker",
      "needs": ["api"],
      "noPort": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `project` | string | Project name (used as service ID prefix) |
| `portRange` | `[min, max]` | Port range reserved for this project |
| `services.<name>.cmd` | string | Dev command (`${PORT}` is replaced with assigned port) |
| `services.<name>.port` | number | Preferred port (next available if taken) |
| `services.<name>.healthPath` | string | Health check path |
| `services.<name>.healthTimeout` | number | Health check timeout in ms (default: 30000) |
| `services.<name>.needs` | string[] | Services that must start first |
| `services.<name>.env` | object | Environment variables for the service |
| `services.<name>.cwd` | string | Working directory (relative to .portdaddyrc) |
| `services.<name>.noPort` | boolean | Service doesn't need a port (e.g., workers) |
| `services.<name>.metadata` | object | Arbitrary metadata |

Config files are searched up the directory tree. Valid names: `.portdaddyrc`, `.portdaddyrc.json`, `portdaddy.config.json`.

### Auto-Detection (`port-daddy scan`)

Port Daddy deep-scans your project and generates a config automatically:

```bash
# Preview what would be generated
port-daddy scan --dry-run

# Scan, save config, and register project
port-daddy scan
```

`scan` walks your directory tree recursively (max depth 5), detects services at every level, handles monorepos and npm workspaces, and registers the project with the daemon for dashboard visibility.

**Supported frameworks (60+):**

| Framework | Default Port | Detection |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Next.js | 3000 | `next.config.*` |
| Nuxt | 3000 | `nuxt.config.*` |
| SvelteKit | 5173 | `svelte.config.js` |
| Remix | 3000 | `remix.config.js` |
| Astro | 4321 | `astro.config.*` |
| Vite | 5173 | `vite.config.*` |
| Angular | 4200 | `angular.json` |
| Create React App | 3000 | `react-scripts` dep |
| Vue CLI | 8080 | `vue.config.js` |
| Express | 3000 | `express` dep |
| Fastify | 3000 | `fastify` dep |
| Hono | 3000 | `hono` dep |
| NestJS | 3000 | `nest-cli.json` |
| http-server | 8080 | `http-server` dep |
| serve | 3000 | `serve` dep |
| FastAPI | 8000 | `requirements.txt` |
| Flask | 5000 | `requirements.txt` |
| Django | 8000 | `manage.py` |
| Cloudflare Workers | 8787 | `wrangler.toml`, `wrangler.json` |
| Docker | 3000 | `Dockerfile`, `compose.yml` |
| Go | 8080 | `go.mod` |
| Rust | 8080 | `Cargo.toml` |

`detect` and `init` still work but print a deprecation notice directing you to `scan`.

### Daemon Config (`config.json`)

The daemon itself is configured via `config.json` in the Port Daddy installation directory:

```json
{
  "service": { "port": 9876, "host": "localhost" },
  "ports": {
    "range_start": 3100,
    "range_end": 9999,
    "reserved": [8080, 8000, 9876]
  },
  "cleanup": {
    "interval_ms": 300000,
    "stale_threshold_ms": 7200000
  },
  "logging": { "level": "info" },
  "security": {
    "rate_limit": { "window_ms": 60000, "max_requests": 100 }
  }
}
```

**Environment variable overrides:**

```bash
PORT_DADDY_PORT=9999           # Daemon port
PORT_DADDY_RANGE_START=4000    # Port range start
PORT_DADDY_RANGE_END=5000      # Port range end
PORT_DADDY_URL=http://host:9876  # SDK/CLI daemon URL
PORT_DADDY_AGENT=my-agent        # Default agent ID for SDK
```

## Examples

### Using with Dev Servers

```bash
# Next.js
PORT=$(port-daddy claim myproject:frontend -q) npm run dev -- --port $PORT

# Vite
PORT=$(port-daddy claim myproject -q) vite --port $PORT

# Express
PORT=$(port-daddy claim myproject:api -q) node server.js
```

### Multi-Agent Build Pipeline

```bash
# Agent A: Build API
port-daddy claim myproject:api
npm run build:api
port-daddy pub build:api '{"status":"complete","port":3100}'

# Agent B: Build Frontend
port-daddy claim myproject:frontend
npm run build:frontend
port-daddy pub build:frontend '{"status":"complete","port":3101}'

# Agent C: Integration Tests (waits for both)
port-daddy sub build:* --json | jq 'select(.status=="complete")' | head -2
npm run test:integration
```

### Bug Fix Handoff

```bash
# Agent A: Reports a bug
port-daddy pub bugs '{"file":"auth.ts","line":42,"desc":"null check missing"}'
port-daddy lock bug-fix-auth

# Agent B: Sees the bug, waits for lock
port-daddy sub bugs
port-daddy lock bug-fix-auth --wait  # Blocks until A releases

# Agent B: Fixes and releases
port-daddy pub bugs '{"file":"auth.ts","status":"fixed"}'
port-daddy unlock bug-fix-auth
```

### File Coordination

```bash
# Agent A: Claims files
port-daddy lock files:src-auth
port-daddy pub files '{"agent":"A","files":["src/auth/*"],"status":"editing"}'

# Agent B: Sees lock, works elsewhere
port-daddy locks --json | jq '.locks[] | select(.name | startswith("files:"))'
# → files:src-auth is locked by A
port-daddy lock files:src-api  # Work on different files

# Agent A: Done
port-daddy pub files '{"agent":"A","files":["src/auth/*"],"status":"done"}'
port-daddy unlock files:src-auth
```
