# Multi-Agent Experiment Log

## Hypothesis

Multiple agents coordinating through Port Daddy can:
1. Discover each other through channel naming conventions
2. Share findings via pub/sub
3. Avoid conflicts via locks
4. Build collective understanding via notes

## Services Running

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| demo-api | TBD | REST API with items CRUD |
| demo-frontend | TBD | Web UI that talks to API |
| demo-worker | N/A | Background poller |

## Agents

| Agent ID | Role | Channel | Status |
