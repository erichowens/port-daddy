**Version:** 1.0 (Reflecting Port Daddy v3.8.0 / v4 Architecture)

## Abstract
As AI agents transition from isolated copilots to collaborative, autonomous swarms, local development environments face a crisis of coordination and trust. Existing tools designed for human-driven, static infrastructures (e.g., Docker Compose, PM2) lack the primitives required to prevent dynamic agents from corrupting shared state or squatting on ephemeral ports. This paper introduces the **Anchor Protocol**, a cryptographic and semantic identity framework built into the Port Daddy daemon. We detail the protocol's evolution from symmetric MACs to asymmetric Ed25519 signatures and multi-hop delegation chains (inspired by Macaroons). Furthermore, we present the formal verification of the protocol's design using the **ProVerif** symbolic analyzer and the mathematical proof of its Rust-based implementation using the **Kani** model checker, demonstrating immunity to algorithm confusion, impersonation, and timing side-channels.

## 1. Introduction: The "Local Swarm" Problem
In a multi-agent development environment, agents operate concurrently to read files, spin up test servers, and execute commands. This introduces three critical threat vectors on `localhost`:
1. **Port Squatting (The "Ghost in the Harbor"):** If Agent A crashes, a malicious or malfunctioning Agent B can bind to Agent A's previously assigned port, intercepting traffic meant for A.
2. **Resource Contention:** Agents fighting over shared resources (e.g., a SQLite database file) without a centralized locking mechanism cause state corruption.
3. **Privilege Escalation:** A "Reviewer" agent delegated by a "Coder" agent should not possess the rights to initiate production deployments, yet local environments rarely enforce principle-of-least-privilege between processes.

To solve this, Port Daddy introduces the concept of a **Harbor**—a zero-trust, namespace-isolated execution environment where agents must prove their identity and capabilities.

## 2. The Anchor Protocol Architecture
The Anchor Protocol defines how agents authenticate to a Harbor and to each other. It issues **Harbor Cards** (highly constrained JSON Web Tokens).

### 2.1 Phase 1: Symmetric Pinning
Early versions of the protocol relied on HS256 (HMAC-SHA256). The primary vulnerability in JWTs is "Algorithm Confusion" (e.g., CVE-2026-22817), where an attacker modifies the token header to `{"alg": "none"}` or symmetric `HS256` while using an asymmetric public key as the HMAC secret.
* **Mitigation:** The Port Daddy Verifier employs strict **Algorithmic Pinning**. It entirely ignores the user-provided `alg` header and explicitly forces the underlying crypto library to evaluate the signature using the pre-determined algorithm.

### 2.2 Phase 2: Asymmetric Identity (Ed25519)
To support decentralized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication without sharing HMAC secrets, the protocol transitioned to **Ed25519 (EdDSA)**.
* **Mechanism:** The Port Daddy Daemon acts as the Root Certificate Authority (CA). Each Harbor is assigned a unique Ed25519 keypair. The Daemon issues Harbor Cards signed by the Harbor's private key. Agents use the Harbor's public key (broadcast via Port Daddy's ambient discovery service) to verify tokens presented by peers.

### 2.3 Phase 3: Stigmergic Delegation (The "Biscuit" Pattern)
Port Daddy v4 introduces multi-hop delegation. When Agent A spawns Agent B, it does not need to request a new token from the Daemon. Instead, it uses **Offline Attenuation**.
* **Mechanism:** Agent A takes its existing Harbor Card, appends a new set of restricted capabilities (e.g., `["db:read"]` reduced from `["db:read", "db:write"]`), and signs the *entire chain* with its own ephemeral private key.
* **Verification:** The Harbor verifies the Daemon's root signature, Agent A's delegation signature, and mathematically ensures that Agent B's capabilities are a strict subset of Agent A's.

## 3. Formal Verification Strategy
Following the industry standard set by AWS (s2n-tls) and Microsoft (Project Everest), we decoupled the verification of the *protocol design* from the verification of the *implementation*.

### 3.1 Symbolic Analysis with ProVerif
To prove the protocol's logical soundness against a Dolev-Yao adversary (an attacker who controls the entire network), we modeled the Anchor Protocol in **ProVerif**.
* **Result:** We successfully proved **Injective Agreement**. For the multi-hop delegation chain, ProVerif confirmed that:
  ```proverif
  query b: id, cap: capability, a: id;
    event(Accepted(b, harbor_id, cap)) ==> 
      (event(IssuedRoot(a, harbor_id, cap)) && event(Delegated(a, b, cap)))
      || event(IssuedRoot(b, harbor_id, cap)).
  ```
  This guarantees that capabilities cannot be escalated and trust is perfectly transitive.

### 3.2 Implementation Verification with Kani (Rust)
A secure protocol is useless if the implementation contains buffer overflows or timing leaks. We extracted the critical JWT parsing and cryptographic comparison logic into a **Rust core**.
* **Memory Safety:** Using the **Kani Rust Verifier** (developed by AWS), we performed bounded model checking to prove that our parsing logic never panics or accesses out-of-bounds memory, regardless of the input payload.
* **Side-Channel Resistance:** To prevent timing attacks where an adversary guesses signatures byte-by-byte, we implemented a custom constant-time byte comparator. Kani formally verified that this comparator is branch-free regarding the contents of the secret arrays.

## 4. Runtime Enforcement: The Arbiter
Formal proofs guarantee behavior *if* the software acts according to the model. To ensure reality matches the model, Port Daddy utilizes an **Arbiter Agent**.
* The Arbiter operates via a zero-cost Foreign Function Interface (FFI) bridge (using `koffi`), allowing the TypeScript daemon to invoke the formally verified Rust core for runtime checks.
* **Enforcement:** The Arbiter subscribes to all `ActivityLog` events. If an agent attempts to claim a port that belongs to a different PID (violating the Anti-Squatting rule), or attempts to lock a resource without the verified capability subset, the Arbiter immediately revokes the agent's Harbor Card and triggers a "Man Overboard" system halt.

## 5. Conclusion
The Anchor Protocol elevates local multi-agent development from a state of "hope-based security" to "math-based security." By combining symbolic protocol proofs (ProVerif), memory-safe implementation proofs (Kani), and runtime ambient enforcement (The Arbiter), Port Daddy provides a formally verified control plane capable of safely orchestrating the next generation of autonomous AI swarms.
