# Port Daddy — The Authoritative Port Manager

**Your ports. My rules. Zero conflicts.**

Port Daddy eliminates the chaos of multi-agent development. No more port collisions. No more wondering what another agent touched. No more lost context between sessions.

## The Compulsory Registration Pattern

**Every agent session should start with registration.** This unlocks resurrection:

```bash
# At session start - register yourself
pd agent register --agent claude-$(date +%s) --name "Feature Builder" --type claude-code --purpose "Implementing dark mode"

# Send heartbeats every 5 minutes (agents marked stale at 10min, dead at 20min)
pd agent heartbeat --agent <your-id>

# Check if another agent died mid-task (do this BEFORE starting new work)
pd salvage
```

Registration is the cost of entry to resurrection. If you die, another agent can pick up your work.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Ports
pd claim myapp:api:main          # Get a stable port (always same for this identity)
pd claim myapp -q                # Quiet mode — just the port number
pd find "myapp:*"                # Find all myapp services
pd release myapp:api:main        # Release when done

# Sessions (multi-agent coordination)
pd session start "Implementing dark mode" --files src/theme.ts src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx
pd note "Created ThemeProvider skeleton, CSS variables approach"
pd note "Blocked on design tokens — need @design-agent input" --type handoff
pd session done "Dark mode complete, tested in Chrome/Safari"

# File conflicts
pd session files add src/api/auth.ts    # Claim a file mid-session
pd sessions --files                      # See who has what files

# Locks (critical sections)
pd lock deployment --owner agent-1 --ttl 300
pd unlock deployment --owner agent-1
```

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Identity Convention: `project:stack:context`

Every service gets a semantic identity. Port Daddy hashes this to a stable port.

| Identity | Port | Use Case |
|----------|------|----------|
| `myapp:api:main` | 9234 | Main API server |
| `myapp:api:feature-auth` | 9847 | Feature branch API |
| `myapp:frontend` | 9156 | Frontend dev server |
| `myapp:db:test` | 9523 | Test database |

**Same identity = same port, every time.** No more "what port was that on?"

### 2. Sessions Are Mutable, Notes Are Immutable

Sessions have a lifecycle:
```
active → completed
active → abandoned
```

Notes are append-only. You can never edit or delete a note. They form the permanent record of what happened. If you wrote it, it happened.

**Why?** When debugging "what went wrong?", you need the full timeline. Edited notes lie.

### 3. File Claims Are Advisory

`pd session files add src/auth.ts` doesn't lock the file. It announces your intent. Other agents see the conflict and can coordinate.

**Why?** Hard locks cause deadlocks. Advisory claims cause conversations.

## Workflows

### Starting a Dev Server

```bash
# 1. Claim your port
PORT=$(pd claim myproject:api -q)

# 2. Start with that port
npm run dev -- --port $PORT

# Or export for the whole shell
eval $(pd claim myproject:api --export)
npm run dev  # Uses $PORT automatically
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

**Agent A** (starting work):
```bash
pd session start "Refactoring auth system" --files src/auth/*.ts
pd note "Splitting monolithic auth.ts into separate modules"
```

**Agent B** (checking before touching auth):
```bash
pd sessions --files
# Output:
# session-a1b2 (active, 12m) - Refactoring auth system
#   Files: src/auth/*.ts
#   Notes: 1

# Sees conflict, coordinates:
pd note "Need to touch src/auth/types.ts — coordinating with @agent-a"
```

**Agent A** (completing):
```bash
pd note "Auth refactor done: auth.ts → login.ts, session.ts, types.ts"
pd session done "Refactored auth into 3 modules, all tests passing"
```

### Leaving Breadcrumbs

Notes support inline markup for cross-referencing:

```bash
pd note "Fixed CORS bug in #file:server.ts:142"
pd note "Handing off to @agent-frontend for UI integration" --type handoff
pd note "Committed: abc123 - CORS headers for API gateway" --type commit
pd note "WARNING: Don't touch auth until tests stabilized" --type warning
```

### Critical Sections with Locks

```bash
# Only one agent can deploy at a time
pd lock deployment --owner $(hostname) --ttl 300

# Do the deployment...
npm run deploy

# Release
pd unlock deployment --owner agent-1
```

Locks auto-expire after TTL (default 60s). Use `--wait` to block until available:

```bash
pd lock deployment --owner agent-1 --wait --timeout 30000
```

## Direct Mode (No Daemon)

Core operations work without the daemon running:

```bash
# These work even if daemon is down (direct SQLite)
pd claim myapp -q
pd session start "Quick fix"
pd note "Fixed the thing"
pd session done
```

**Tier 1 (no daemon):** claim, release, find, lock, unlock, session, note, notes, status
**Tier 2 (daemon required):** pub/sub, SSE, webhooks, orchestration (up/down)

## Dashboard

- Active services and their ports

## When to Use Port Daddy

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Starting any dev server | `pd claim <identity> -q` |
| Multi-file refactoring | `pd session start` + claim files |
| Handing off to another agent | `pd note --type handoff` |
| Critical section (deploy, migrate) | `pd lock` |
| Debugging "what happened?" | `pd notes` or `pd sessions` |
| Port conflict | `pd find "*"` to see what's claimed |

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**
- Use raw port numbers (`--port 3000`) — they collide
- Edit files without checking `pd sessions --files`
- Forget to end sessions — stale sessions confuse future agents
- Skip notes — your future self (or another agent) needs context

**Do:**
- Always claim ports through Port Daddy
- Start sessions for non-trivial work
- Leave notes liberally — they're cheap
- End sessions when done (even if abandoning)

## Worktree-Aware Development

Port Daddy tracks which git worktree you're in. Sessions automatically scope to the worktree:

```bash
# Main worktree
cd ~/coding/myproject
pd session start "Feature A"  # session-a1b2 in main worktree

# Chaos testing worktree
cd ~/coding/myproject-chaos
pd session start "Breaking things"  # session-c3d4 in chaos worktree

# See all sessions across worktrees
pd sessions --all-worktrees
```

### Multi-Daemon Development

For developing Port Daddy itself:

```bash
# Production daemon (your daily driver)
pd claim port-daddy:daemon:prod      # → 9876

# Development daemon (testing changes)  
cd ~/coding/port-daddy
PORT=$(pd claim port-daddy:daemon:dev -q)  # → 9877
npm run dev -- --port $PORT

# Chaos daemon (adversarial testing)
cd ~/coding/port-daddy-chaos  
PORT=$(pd claim port-daddy:daemon:chaos -q)  # → 9878
npm run dev -- --port $PORT
```

## Local DNS for Ports (Experimental)

Instead of remembering `localhost:9234`, use semantic names:

```bash
# Register a DNS name for your service
pd claim myapp:api --dns
# Now accessible at: http://myapp-api.local

# Works with any claimed service
pd claim frontend:react --dns
# → http://frontend-react.local

# List DNS registrations
pd dns list
# myapp-api.local      → 127.0.0.1:9234
# frontend-react.local → 127.0.0.1:9156
```

**Requirements:** macOS (uses mDNS/Bonjour), or Linux with avahi-daemon.

## Agent Resurrection (Salvage)

When an agent dies mid-task, its work isn't lost. Port Daddy captures session state and notes:

```bash
# At session start, check if someone died with unfinished work
pd salvage

# Sample output:
# Dead agent: builder-1 (died 15 minutes ago)
#   Purpose: Building the payment API
#   Session: session-a1b2c3 (active, 3 notes)
#   Last note: "Finished Stripe integration, starting PayPal"
#   Files: src/payments/stripe.ts, src/payments/paypal.ts

# Claim the dead agent's session and continue their work
pd salvage --claim builder-1

# Clear salvage queue after you've reviewed it
pd salvage --clear
```

**Always check salvage before starting new work.** Someone might have died mid-task.

## Changelog (Hierarchical Change Tracking)

Record meaningful changes with identity-based rollup:

```bash
# Record a change
pd changelog add myapp:api:auth "Added JWT refresh token endpoint" --type feature

# With detailed description
pd changelog add myapp:frontend "Fixed mobile nav overlap" --type fix \
  --description "Nav was overlapping content on iOS Safari viewport"

# List recent changes
pd changelog list

# Filter by identity (includes children)
pd changelog list --identity myapp:api

# Different formats
pd changelog list --format tree
pd changelog list --format keep-a-changelog
```

Changes roll up hierarchically:
- `myapp:api:auth` appears under `myapp:api` which appears under `myapp`
- Query `myapp` to see all changes across the entire project

### Change Types

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feature` | New functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fixes |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |
| `docs` | Documentation updates |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |
| `breaking` | Breaking changes |
